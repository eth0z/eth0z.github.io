      <h2>Removing A RAT From A macOS Machine</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Removing a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) or any malware from a macOS machine involves several steps:
    <br>
    Disconnect from the Internet: Immediately disconnect your Mac from the internet to prevent the RAT from communicating with its controller or spreading further.
    <br>
    Use Built-in Security Tools: macOS has built-in security features like XProtect and Gatekeeper that help detect and prevent malware. Ensure they are up to date by installing the latest macOS updates.
    <br>
    Run Malware Removal Tools: Utilize reputable antivirus or antimalware software specifically designed for macOS. Tools like Malwarebytes for Mac, Avast Security, or Sophos Antivirus for Mac can help detect and remove RATs and other malware.
    <br>
    Check Activity Monitor: Look for any suspicious processes or applications running on your Mac using the Activity Monitor. Terminate any unfamiliar processes that could be associated with the RAT.
    <br>
    Review Login Items: Check your System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items for any suspicious applications set to launch at startup. Remove any unknown or suspicious items.
    <br>
    Reset Browser Settings: Sometimes, malware affects browsers. Resetting browser settings can help remove malicious extensions or settings.
    <br>
    Backup and Restore: If the RAT persists, consider restoring your Mac from a Time Machine backup taken before the infection occurred. Ensure the backup is clean and free from the RAT before restoring.
    <br>
    Consult with Professionals: If you're unsure or uncomfortable with these steps, seek guidance from an Apple-certified professional or tech support to safely remove the malware.
    <br>
    Regularly update your macOS and applications, and practice caution while downloading software or files from the internet to prevent future infections.
