    <p>Removing a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) from a Windows computer involves a few steps:
    <br>
    Disconnect from the Internet: Disable your network connection to prevent the RAT from communicating with its controller or spreading further.
    <br>
    Use an Antivirus Software: Run a reputable antivirus or antimalware program to scan and remove the RAT. Make sure your antivirus definitions are up to date for better detection.
    <br>
    Perform Full System Scan: Scan your entire system thoroughly to identify and eliminate any malicious files or programs associated with the RAT.
    <br>
    Use Malware Removal Tools: Consider using specialized malware removal tools designed to target specific RATs. Tools like Malwarebytes, Spybot Search & Destroy, or others may assist in detecting and removing RATs.
    <br>
    Check Task Manager and Startup Items: Look for suspicious processes or applications in the Task Manager. Disable any suspicious programs from starting up automatically by checking the Startup tab in Task Manager.
    <br>
    System Restore or Reinstallation: If the RAT persists, you might need to perform a system restore to a point before the infection occurred or, in severe cases, reinstall the operating system to completely remove the malware.
    <br>
    Update Security Software and System: Ensure your antivirus software, operating system, and all applications are up to date with the latest security patches to prevent future infections.
